## Objective

Be the first player to discard all your cards. You can also play multiple rounds and score points, with the lowest score after a set number of rounds declared the winner.

## Setup

1. **Shuffling:** Thoroughly shuffle the deck.
2. **Dealing:** Each player receives 7 cards.
3. **Starting Pile:** Place the remaining deck facedown to form the draw pile. Flip the top card to start the discard pile. If the top card is a Wild or Wild Draw Four, shuffle it back into the deck and draw a new card.

## Game Play

### Basic Turn Mechanics

1. **Playing a Card:** Players must match the top card of the discard pile by color, number, or symbol. Alternatively, they can play a Wild card.
2. **Drawing a Card:** If a player cannot play a card, they must draw one card from the draw pile.
   - If the drawn card can be played, the player may immediately do so.
   - If the drawn card cannot be played, the turn passes to the next player.
3. **Special Cards:** If a player plays an action or power card, follow the specific rules for that card.

### Card Types and Mechanics

#### Number Cards (0-9)

- **Description:** Basic cards with numbers 0-9 in four colors (red, green, blue, yellow).
- **Mechanics:** Match the top card of the discard pile by either the same number or the same color.

#### Action Cards

1. **Switch Card (Reverse)**
   - **Description:** Reverses the direction of play.
   - **Mechanics:** If play is moving clockwise, it will switch to counterclockwise, and vice versa. If there are only two players, it functions as a Skip card.

2. **Skip Card**
   - **Description:** Skips the next player's turn.
   - **Mechanics:** The next player in the sequence loses their turn, and the turn moves to the following player.

3. **Draw Two Card**
   - **Description:** Forces the next player to draw two cards and lose their turn.
   - **Mechanics:** The next player must draw two cards from the draw pile and miss their turn.

#### Wild Cards

1. **Wild Card**
   - **Description:** Can be played on any card.
   - **Mechanics:** The player who plays this card chooses the next color to be played.

2. **Wild Draw Four Card**
   - **Description:** Forces the next player to draw four cards and lose their turn. The player who plays this card also chooses the next color to be played.
   - **Mechanics:** The next player must draw four cards and miss their turn. This card can only be played if the player has no other playable cards that match the current color.

#### Power Cards

1. **Swap Hands**
   - **Description:** Allows the player to swap their hand with another player of their choice.
   - **Mechanics:** After playing this card, the player chooses any other player and swaps hands with them. The game then proceeds with the next player's turn.

2. **Play Again**
   - **Description:** Allows the player to take an additional turn immediately after playing this card.
   - **Mechanics:** The player plays another card immediately after the "Play Again" card. If they cannot play another card, they must draw a card, but they can still play the drawn card if it is playable.

3. **Shield Block**
   - **Description:** Blocks any action card played against the player.
   - **Mechanics:** If an action card (e.g., Draw Two, Wild Draw Four) is played against the player, they can counter it with a Shield Block card, negating its effect. The Shield Block is then discarded, and the player who played the action card resumes their turn.

### Special Rounds (Optional)

To add variety, consider including special rounds where unique rules apply. For example:
- **Double Trouble Round:** Action cards have double the effect (e.g., Draw Two becomes Draw Four).
- **Extra Draw Round:** Players must draw an additional card at the beginning of their turn.
- **Speed Round:** Players have a limited time to play their card (e.g., 5 seconds), or they must draw a card.

## Winning the Game

- **Single Round Win:** The first player to discard all their cards wins the round.
- **Scoring System (for multiple rounds):** Players score points based on the cards remaining in their hands.
  - Number cards: Face value (0-9 points).
  - Action cards: 20 points each.
  - Wild and Wild Draw Four cards: 50 points each.
  - Power cards: 50 points each.
- The game can be played until a player reaches a predetermined score (e.g., 500 points). The player with the lowest score at that point wins.

## Example Turn

1. **Starting Card:** The discard pile shows a red 5.
2. **Player 1:** Has a red 2 and plays it.
3. **Player 2:** Has no red cards but plays a yellow 2, matching the number.
4. **Player 3:** Plays a yellow Skip card. Player 4 is skipped.
5. **Player 5:** Plays a yellow Wild Draw Four. Chooses blue as the new color. Player 6 draws four cards and loses their turn.
6. **Player 1:** Plays a blue 7.
7. **Player 2:** Plays a blue Switch card, reversing play direction.
8. **Player 1:** (again) Plays a Shield Block in anticipation, preventing the next Draw Two card from affecting them.
